// MFG-Unlocker's ported XMX multi frame model, driven the same way it drives it.
//
// libxess_fg.dll only ships the DP4a model (18). With more than one generated frame XeFG would use its MFG model (16),
// which that build doesn't have, so it falls back to 18 and every generated frame gets its own optical flow field.
// MFG-Unlocker ports model 16 into the loaded library: the model catalog entry, its graph, and the ported XMX
// programs that compute one optical flow field for the whole batch.
